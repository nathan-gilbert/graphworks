# Graphworks

## A graph theoretic module for Python

This is a very old project I created for a class as an Undergrad. It's not in a
working state at the moment but I'm interested in getting back into mathematics
so am slowly reworking it and improving the code quality.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* virtualenv
* numpy
* graphviz

### Install the required packages

```sh
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
```

### Start the virtualenv

```sh
source ./env/bin/activate
```

### You can deactivate the virtualenv with

```sh
deactivate
```

### Lastly, install the required libraries

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

TODO

## Notes

1. Currently, weighted graphs can only be entered using an adjacency matrix.

# Graphworks

## A graph theoretic module for Python

This is a very old project I created for a project as an Undergrad. It's
probably not in a working state at the moment but I'm interested in getting
back into mathematics so am slowly reworking it.

### Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Numeric Python
* dotty - Graphviz software/libraries.
* numpy

### Usage

## Notes

1. Currently, weighted graphs can only be entered using an adjacency matrix.
